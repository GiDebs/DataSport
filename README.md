# DataSport 
**Self-organizer of workouts**

## The idea

This project aims at creating an web app application called *DataSport* to keep visible and organized all my workouts. I want to be able to see the relevant data of my training without being forced to follow the schemes of TrainingPeaks or Garmin platforms. I want everything easy for reviews in one single place. Additionally this is my first attempt in the programming world and I will use this idea to learn-by-doing hopefully gaining some skills.

## Where the data will come from
The main source of data will be from the TrainingPeaks .csv files. It could be possible to implement the database with data from Gramin Connect .csv files in order to collect more informations and provide a more detailed Recap.

## How the excel file will be organized
- There will be Graphic User Interface that will ask something to the user: Import new data / See the existing analysis (Dashboard) / Exit the program 
- I would like to organize the window like a tree. From the Dashboard you will see the main overall data, and you can zoon the details of it in different sheets.
- There will be a sheet called *AllWorkouts* where i will see all my activities, and if possible add filters like in excel.
- There will be a sheet called *WeekRecap* where gather relevant data from *AllWorkouts* database in a user-friendly approach. Then monthly, quaterly, annual recaps will be computed.
- I would like to update the same dataset *DataSport* as long as I keep going on with training sessions.

### The Current issues
- Not sure if the best way to do this is creating a web app or creating a desktop app. Need first to learn the difference and understand which files they require to run
